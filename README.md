# SynRaceRebalancer
This Synthesis Patcher allows tweaking of various race-related stats.

Supports global changes - allowing for adjustments of stats across the board for all creatures from all mods.

## Supported mods:
- Skyrim, Dragonborn, Dawnguard
- Should be able to pick up creatures/races from other mods, if they use correct keywords and/or if adaptations are made within the patcher to account for them.
- If a mod is not supported, please create an issue of non-supported races (Editor IDs, Names, and any keywords they have - use SSE Edit to pull these values)

## Tweaks
- Turn modules on and off as needed via Synthesis Patcher settings.
- Add flags (Swims, Regen in Combat, for example) to races.
- Adjust the base name. By default the patcher changes names to Morrowind-style names.
- Adjust base Health, Magicka, Stamina
- Adjust base Regeneration of all of the above.
- Adjust racial skill bonuses.
- Adjust Vampire/Child modifiers - Vampires and children 'inherit' the stats of the non-child, non-parent race, and can be awarded a percentage of the 'parent' race stats. As such, vampires can be given improved regeneration and carryweight, whilst children can be given a small percentage of the non-child race stats.
